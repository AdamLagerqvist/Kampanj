        <p class="more-margin-top"><em>Did you know that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased by about 110 ppm since before the 1800-hundreds and that it has never before increased with more than 30ppm over a span of a millenia.</em></p>
        <p><em>This increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has in turn led to increased temperatures and raised sea levels. This is a problem! </em></p>
        <p>Are you also aware of that the United States government spent approximately 4.5 trillion dollars in fiscal year 2019, and that about 16% of this money was spent on the army whilst only 0,5% went towards NASA and it’s space research.</p>
        <p>That is why our goal here at<em class="italic"> The Advanced Space Colonization Agency </em>is to increase awareness and funding of space research and colonization programs since it is the only solution to this conundrum we find ourselves in.</p>
        <p>These are the reasons we will be raising money for space programs located in the U.S such as NASA and space X with our brand new “We need more space!” campaign.</p>
        <p>Any contributions are appreciated, financial or otherwise!</p>

        <p><em><u class="more-margin-top">FAQ</u></em></p>
        <p>Q: What happens with the money?</p>
        <p>A: We are a non profit organization, so everything will be split amongst the different research groups.</p>
        <p class="more-margin-top">Q: How can I contribute if not financially.</p>
        <p>A: Raising awareness is by far the best. One way you can do this is by sharing our campaign on social media.</p>
        <p class="more-margin-top">Q: Why only space programs in the U.S</p>
        <p>A: Because they have the biggest budget and thus also the best tools to do the most with the money. Also if we spreaad the money to too many sorces it will not make as big of a differance as it will if we keep the number of orinasations low.</p>
