        <h2 class="more-margin-top">Did you know that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased by about 110 ppm since before the 1800-hundreds and that it has never before increased with more than 30ppm over a span of a millenia.</h2>
        <h2> This increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has in turn led to increased temperatures and raised sea levels. This is a problem!</h2>
        <p>Are you also aware of that the United States government spent approximately 4.5 trillion dollars in fiscal year 2019, and that about 16% of this money was spent on the army whilst only 0,5% went towards NASA and it’s space research.</p>
        <p>That is why our goal here at<em> The Advanced Space Colonization Agency </em>is to increase awareness and funding of space research and colonization programs since it is the only solution to this conundrum we find ourselves in.</p>
        <p>These are the reasons we will be raising money for space programs located in the U.S such as NASA and space X with our brand new “We need more space!” campaign.</p>
        <p>Any contributions are appreciated, financial or otherwise!</p>
